# Remapping of neural code during NREM
Modelling and Analysis code for study Acetylcholine-gated current translates wake neuronal firing rate information into a spike timing-based code in Non-REM sleep, stabilizing neural network dynamics during memory consolidation

## Mem_Sim.cpp

This file simulates the model and generates spiketimes for the study, parameters change according to methods
To use, change output directory on line 250 to match personal directory

```bash
string fileBase = "/mnt/c/Users/eniwbola/Desktop/Research/Quinton_Proj/noiseSweep/noiseSweep/new_het_scan_stability_4_4_2021/review_run/cut_off_inh_34/7_21_2021/tau_300_real_mem_scan_34/";

```

## Stability_Calc.m
The function calculates  Network Stability 
sData is a x by 3 matrix containing neuron IDs, excitatory inhibtory id , spiketimes, skipTime delineates first start time where as skipTime2 delineates the
second start time. Functional connectivity is calculated for two time periods and compares for FuNS


## Lfp_Power_Spectrum_Calc.m
This function calculates  LFP and Power spectrum sData is a x by 3 matrix containing neuron IDs, excitatory inhibtory id , spiketimes, 
 skipTime delineates first start time.  The LFP is generated by convolving a gaussion on spiketimes of unit value, the power spectrum is the computed based on this trace

##  Spike_and_spectrum_analysis.m 
 Plots Spike Rasters, calculates and plots Power Spectrum and Local Field
 Potential trace

## Stability_vs_Noise_git.m
Loads and creates stability vs noise plot and stability vs memory size



## Remaining folders
Remaining folders contain simulation data from choice simulation
Spikedata contains times and neuron ids for spike times
Code contains simulation code
